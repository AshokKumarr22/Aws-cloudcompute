what is AWS
AWS means Amazon cloud service
It is a cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services like core services,storage,databases,networking services
It provides 200+ services


what is cloud computing
cloud computing is a delivery of computing services like  core services,storage,databases,networking services



#CORE SERVICES:
-----------
1.COMPUTE SERVICES:
----------------
*1.EC2
 2.Elb
 3.Auto scaling
*LAMBDA
*ELASTIC BEANSTALK

what is EC2
EC2 means Elastic cloud compute
It is a core service that helps to create virtual machines and to run our websites or applications


what is Elb
Elb means Elastic load balancer
->load balancer controls all the traffic and shares requests equally with the help of route table across multiple ec2 instances
->it checks the health status of servers
->if new server is added ,elb records it in the target group
->if one server is terminated ,elb stops forwarding requests
->we have 4 types of elb 
  1.ALB(Application lb)
  2.CLB(Classic lb)
  3.NLB(Network lb)
  4.GWLB(Gateway lb)
->we can use autoscaling in elb also,if the traffic is on demand


what is Auto scaling
->when the traffic is on demand,1 server cant control,it can crash
->by using auto scaling method,it adds new instance on demand and terminates automatically when demand is low
->it helps to handle traffic spikes and also saves cost during low usage
->if we use auto scaling method,defnetly we use elb..without elb autoscaling process not usable


what is lambda
lambda is a serverless compute service that helps to run our code without managing services



2.STORAGE SERVICES:
---------------
*S3
*EFS
*EBS

what is S3
s3 means simple storage service that helps to store our files in objects forms 
->we call folders as a buckets
->high scalability,latency,availabity

what is EBS
EBS means Elastic block storage that store data in block forms
->it is used as a virtual harddisk to connect ec2 
->it can accessible only one ec2 instance at a time

what is EFS
EFS is a Elastic file system
->it is a network file system that can shared access file systems across multiple servers
->it can accessible from multiple ec2 instances at once


3.DATABASE SERVICES:
----------------
*RDS
*DYNAMO DB


4.NETWORK SERVICES:
-----------------
*vpc
*Route 53

what is vpc
->vpc means virtual private cloud
->It provides an isolated network that controls who can access what in ur aws..we can create our own vpc
->Aws provides a default vpc for beginners
->we have some concepts in vpc
cidr block     -   
ip address     -   it gives the size of vpc and subnets
subnets        -   subnets are smaller network in vpc like a rooms in our home
 public        -   the subnet with internet connection
 private       -   the subnet without internet connection
igw            -   igw gives internet to vpc and public subnet,it is like a gate to our home
ngw            -   ngw takes internet from igw and sends to private subnet to receive data
Route table    -   route tables shows routes to specified subnets
elb            -   elb controls all the requests and shares each requests to all instances
auto scaling   -   as helps to add instances when the traffic is high and terminate instances when traffic is decrease
sg             -   used for security purpose..it allows only inbound rules
nacl           -   used for security purpose..it allows inbound and outbound rules


diff b/w sg and nacl
       sg                                                 nacl
       --                                                  --
->security groups                               ->network access control list
->it acts as a firewall at instance level       ->it acts as a firewall at subnets level
->it controls only inbound rules                ->it controls inbound and outbound rules
->stateful in nature                            ->stateless in nature
->can use max 5 sg                              ->use 1 nacl



what is Route 53 in aws
Route 53 service in aws is used for dns hosting service
->we can buy our domain from aws or from other services
->aws allows domain from other seller
->once domain registration is completed,we can record it into hosted zone..
->hosted zone is the place where the dns records are saved
->and also route 53 helps to check the health checks of web servers
 simply say:
 ---------
 Route 53 service is used for dns service..it takes the domain name from user and convert into ip address 
and also it helps to check the health-checkups for web servers



#SECURITY SERVICES:
----------------
*IAM
*MAF

what is Iam service
Iam means Identity Access Management
Identity - Authentication
->if we use or work on aws services and resources,we cant directly do it,we have an account in aws.
->this process is authentication..if we have a account in aws,we entered only into aws console but not do anything
  because of permissions denied
Access - Authorisation
->if we use aws services we have an access means permissions
Iam service helps to provide security access for users to use aws resources
we have 4 major resources in Iam
1.Iam user:
   -----
we have 2 types of users in aws
1.Root user
2.iam user
->Root user is the owner of the account..so he has access to al services
iam users are the persons that we give specified access to aws resources
 ex:if a developer wants to assign a aws..we create as iam user and passwd to login into aws
 2.Policies:
 ---------
 ->policies is ntg but permissions 
 ->by attaching policies to iam users,we can access them
 ->we have 2 types of policies
    1.Aws managed policy
    2.custom policy
->aws already gave some created policies
->users can create own policies by using json or visual formats as per their needs
3.Groups:
-------
->Groups are combination of iam users i.e; each team has a group like
  all dev beongs to dev group
->by attaching policies to each person is slightly hard so we can attach policies directly to groups
->ex:if we add a new dev into dev group,he has that group permissions.seperately we doesnt add  policies
4.Iam Roles:
----------
->iam roles are used for temporary credentials to access services and resources
->our data is very secure by using iam roles


what is cloud front
cloud front is a content delivery network service provided by aws
->it delivers the content to users with high speed and low latency
Ex(use case):
---------
->If a user requests contents..requests goes to neartest cloud front edge location first
->if the content is cached,cloud front delivers it fastly
->if the content is not there,cloud front cached data from origin server and cached it into nearest 
  edge location and delivers fastly
->and also it cached for future purposes
Benefits:
-------
fast delivery   - delivers the content fastly
reduce latency  - data travelling is reduces
security        - allowws https
scalability     - controls high traffic load


diff cloud watch and cloud trail
cloud watch:
--------
->cloud watch is used to monitoring aws services and resources like metrics and logging
->collect logs from applications and services
->we set set alarms if something wents wrong
ex:
--
->we set the alarm,when the cpu crosses above 80%,alarms trigger
->cloud watch notifies us as a sms or email
->we can view the data on cloud watch dashboards
cloud trail:
---------
->cloud trails is a aws service helps to monitoring users activities 
->the events that are recorded and delivered it into s3,we checkit in s3
->we can observe,analize or set alarm to detect this troubleshoot issues
